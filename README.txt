********************

Write an Object Oriented Python (3.6.X) program that:

# simulates a 2D world made by a rectangular matrix of cells, containing walls, robots, or energy food.
# each cell can contain: 0 : nothing,  RX : a robot indexed by  X, # : a wall section, o : energy food.
# robots can wander around only through Nord, South, Est, West directions.
# a robot can only enter an empty cell or a cell with energy food.
# each robot has a SENSE-THINK-ACT controller software architecture. Each robot may have its own THINK algorithm, different from the others.
# when a robot finds energy food in a cell were it enters, the simulator increases its score, the food is deleted and the cell is only occupied by the incoming robot.
# at each simulation step , record and print an ordered list of high scores of robots.
# when the food is all taken the simulation is ended.

The software prjoject should have files in a folder with subfolders per Python packages.

Upload a single ZIP file containing all the folders/files system.
